                  description="Palm oil is a cheap ingredient that has widely been used in a lot of American food, cosmetics, and
cleaning products. To keep up with the rising demand for this ingredient and to keep costs low, rainforest
in south - east Asia are being slash to make way for more palm oil plantations. With more demand, the
race for an alternative is on the rise. C16 Biosciences is a biotechnology company founded in 2018
focusing on creating a sustainable alternative to palm oil through advanced microbial fermentation
technology. This lab - grown palm oil alternative feeds on sugars to then excrete an oil essentially made
up of the same compound structure as palm oil. This company is in the growing movement to retire our
reliance on natural resourcing that causes environmental harm. If this start up can scale and match a
similar cheap price point to palm oil, further deforestation will be prevented.
